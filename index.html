        <p>My name is Greg and I live in Austin, Tx. I'm currently studying web development at University of Texas!</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Florida but I have lived all over the United States including Hawaii.</p>
        <p>I graduated in 2006 from high school and became the youngest Realtor in my city. I always had the dream of flipping houses and creating my own business as an entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>I then went into hospitality in 2008 at the Ritz Carlton in Sarasota, Fl. After a few years I moved to Kauai, Hawaii. I worked at the Grand Hyatt Resort and Spa and at the Poipu Beach Surf School as an instructor.</p>
        <p>I then moved to South Carolina and worked as a Sales Consultant at GMC. I also started my own business in network marketing with Lifevantage an anti-aging supplement company.</p>
        <p>Through my passion of improving peoples lives using fitness and nutrition, I built a successful personal training business at Golds Gym in Austin, Tx. I hold three personal training certifications, two specialty ceritfications in trigger point release thearapy and MMA training. Also a CPR/AED certification.</p>
        <p>Since living in Austin, Tx. I have trained in Mixed Martial Arts for three years. The process of learning MMA has given me a greater work ethic and the pain of training has tested my mental and physical strength. It helped me understand that you can do anything you put your mind to with hard work and consistancy.</p>
        <p>My own struggles with fitness and health gives me insight, compassion and patients in teaching and developing others with similar goals.</p>
        <p>The exciting field of technology would allow me to reach more people and influence our world in a positive way by enriching peoples lives.</p>
        <p>My passions include software development, cooking, working out and helping people improve themselves.</p>
        <p>Currently working at the Four Seasons Hotel and looking for opportunities in technology.
